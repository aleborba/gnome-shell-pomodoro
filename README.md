## What is the pomodoro technique?

The [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_technique) is a time and focus management method which improves productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should relax. This cycle repeats once it reaches 4th break – then you should take a longer break (have a walk or something). It's that simple. It improves your focus, physical health and mental agility depending on how you spend your breaks and how strictly you follow the routine.

# Usage
- Use toggle switch (or *Ctrl+Alt+P*) to toggle timer on/off
- You can configure behavior of the extension in *Options* menu

...and there are a couple of options:
- _Reset Counts and Timers_: Resets your pomodoro session count.
- _Away From Desk_: Automatically start next pomodoro session after pause. Useful if you're sitting away from computer.
- _Control Presence Status_: During a pomodoro session, mark your IM presence status to Busy.
- _Fullscreen Notifications_: After completion of a pomodoro session, show a dialog box (system modal) that will force you to take a break :)
- _Sound Notifications_: Notify completion of pomodoro by playing a sound.

# Settings
We recommend you use the Options menu to configure Pomodoro extension. If you still want to tinker with settings, you can use dconf-editor or gsettings via commandline. Settings for Pomodoro are in */org/gnome/shell/extensions/pomodoro* tree.

**Change notification sound**

You can customize notification sound with:

        gsettings [--schemadir=~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/pomodoro@arun.codito.in/schemas/] set org.gnome.shell.extensions.pomodoro sound-uri "file:///usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga"

**Change keyboard shortcut**

Hotkey to toggle the timer *Ctrl+Alt+P* may be used in one of your apps (Emacs, Sublime Text, etc.), in which case it will toggle the timer. You can change the shortcut by:

        gsettings [--schemadir=~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/pomodoro@arun.codito.in/schemas/] set org.gnome.shell.extensions.pomodoro toggle-key "['<Super>p']"
